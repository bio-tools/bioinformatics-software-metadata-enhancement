# Introduction

The Tools Ecosystem is a centralized repository for the open and transparent exchange of metadata about software tools and services in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences.
It serves as the foundation for the sustainability of the diverse Tools Platform services, and for the interoperability between all these essential services (bio.tools, BioContainers, OpenEBench, Bioconda, WorkflowHub, usegalaxy.eu) and related resources outside of the ELIXIR Tools Platform (e.g. Bioschemas).

The goal of this project is to cross-compare and analyze the metadata centralized in the Tools Ecosystem to maintain high quality descriptions, together with the EDAM ontology [@usesDataFrom:10.1093/bioinformatics/btt113] [@usesDataFrom:jon_ison_2020_3899895] linked used for many annotations of these resources. In order to achieve these goals we need to design tools and processes that detect curation bottlenecks, perform rigorous data cross-validation and generate detailed reporting about potential issues and actionable items.

Multiple strategies will be explored:
- Comparison of the functional profiles of bio.tools entries with the corresponding semantic constraints defined in EDAM. Develop software to identify and report on inconsistencies between resources.
- Comparison of the metadata defining a software tool with the knowledge extracted from publications that cite it, as well as the workflows that use it.

Beyond the immediate improvement of the metadata, we plan to use the results of these analyses in order to:
- Automate relevant analyses using continuous integration mechanisms (extending previous and current work in EDAM and the Tools Ecosystem)
- Improve curation user interfaces to reduce the risk of annotation errors.
- Provide high quality functional tool profiles to be used in the context of workflow annotation

Another important goal is to provide onboarding of and support for scientific communities joining the Biohackathon.

Given the nature of the data we use in this project, we will be working in close collaboration with the project "Enhance RDM in Galaxy by utilizing RO-Crates", who will also be leveraging workflow and software metadata from the same resources.
